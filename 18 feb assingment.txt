1) What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.
= API is Application Programming Interface, 
ex = REST API , SOAP 
api is mostly used for communicating between two software.
ex = google map communicating with ola.

2) Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.
= Complexity: APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain. 
Compatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same s
oftware system or between different systems, which can lead to errors and system failures.

3) What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.
= A web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser.
API is an interface that exposes an application's data to outside software, whereas web applications are one type of API with stricter requirements

4)Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.
= SOAP is difficult to implement and it requires more bandwidth whereas REST is easy to implement and requires less bandwidth such as smartphones. 
Benefits of SOAP over REST as SOAP has ACID compliance transaction.
Some of the applications require transaction ability which is accepted by SOAP whereas REST lacks in it


5) Differentiate between REST and SOAP.
=  The SOAP approach is highly structured and uses XML data format. REST is more flexible and allows applications to exchange data in multiple formats.
